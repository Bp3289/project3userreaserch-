Description: 
An anonymous, virtual “buddy” to help connect survivors with support resources via a conversation-like interface.

Why: 
Provide easy access to support resources, and to bridge the gap between people who need support with professionals who are qualified to help. 

Problem to solve: 
We’re not trying to solve the entire problem of sexual assault/trauma with our app - we can't - but we can try to inspire communication and survivor empowerment by bridging the gap between people who need help, and professionals who are qualified to do so. 

Design Principles: 
Speed, accessibility, and user anonymity.
