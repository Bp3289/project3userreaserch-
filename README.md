Description: 
An anonymous, virtual “buddy” to help connect survivors with support resources via a conversation-like interface.

Why: 
Provide easy access to support resources, and to bridge the gap between people who need support with professionals who are qualified to help. 

Problem to solve: 
We’re not trying to solve the entire problem of sexual assault/trauma with our app - we can't - but we can try to inspire communication and survivor empowerment by bridging the gap between people who need help, and professionals who are qualified to do so. 

Design Principles: 
Speed, accessibility, and user anonymity.

4.  Professional approach on things, not judgmental.
5.  That they are there for me.

7.  Depends on severity, non-judgemental source.
8.  FitnessPal, PayPal, Wellsfargo.
9.  Have a lot of control on who sees my info, a sense of higher security.
10.  Lean less towards apps you have to download, more so websites for ambiguity, able to        cover your tracks. Apps on a phones are harder to hide quickly.

After conducting these interviews I realized a couple of key ideas to take away from this:

1. Privacy is HUGE!
2. Anonymity will also be vital to this project.
3. Users want an escape route for the website to cover their tracks
4. Users won't feel comfortable with this being a phone app, unless the app can be hidden or disguised well.
5. Users do feel like there is a need for this website.
6. The users I interviewed didn't know of any resources over physical and emotional abuse. The only answer they gave me is "internet", which tells me there could be a real need for this.
7. Found out users don't want to feel alone.


All of these answers have shaped the way I'm viewing this project. I knew going into this that anonymity would be key, but now I see it will be vital to this project. I gained a real sense for how important this website can be for everyone. After conducting these interviews, one major addition to the app that we previously didn't have were testimonials, users in these dire situations really want a sense of "not being alone", so testimonials will be a nice addition to our app.
